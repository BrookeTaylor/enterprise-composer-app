    <h3>About This App</h3>

    <p>This project began as part of a Web 425 Angular course, where the goal was
      to learn Angular fundamentals while implementing asynchronous data handling
      using the async pipe. The original version featured a basic composer list
      with a working search bar powered by Angularâ€™s reactive capabilities.
    </p>

    Now updated to the latest version of Angular, this app includes:

    <ul>
      <li>A wider selection of composers and genres</li>
      <li>Refined sort and filter functionality</li>
      <li>An enhanced user interface for a more modern and responsive experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whether you're a student, musician, or simply someone who loves to
      explore classical and contemporary music, this app is designed to help you
      discover and study with composers from all eras with ease.
